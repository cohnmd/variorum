<h1>variorum</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
variorum is a project that aims to make the fragments of the Greek comic poets as accessible and useful as possible.
It will offer full text search of the fragments and context, including emendations and alternate readings;
the ability to tag and search fragments by subject; translations; a curated bibliography; and a toolkit for manipulating the text.
Only a few fragments of the 5th century poet Krates are currently encoded to demo the project. <a href="/demo/container.php?fr=kratesfr27">See a sample fragment</a>; or: <a href="/demo/search.html">search the available fragments.</a>
<h2>Why is it?</h2>
	Over the course of my research, I have come to rely on digital editions of text; yet one area where these are deficient is the Greek comic fragments (and fragmentary texts more generally). My dissertation made extensive use of fragmentary texts, and, when I finished it, I began a commentary on the comic poet Krates. As part of this project, I began developing a framework for making the fragments more useful to laymen and scholars alike. Of the digital resources, the <a href="http://www.tlg.uci.edu/">TLG</a> in particular is a landmark achievement. But, as yet, it doesn't include every edition of every text, nor do editions have an apparatus criticus.
	One cannot, therefore, include in the search alternate readings and emendations in these fragments, whose text and interpretation may be very fraught and controversial. I also thought it would be useful to give the user the option of displaying the fragments in context.
	<BR/><BR/>Another consideration was the usefulness and accessibility of the fragments. A substantial number of these fragments remain, and they are a trove of information about not only comedy and its development but also the culture of Classical Athens more generally. Yet they had no good translation into English until Ian Storey's recent <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/fragments-of-old-comedy/oclc/676725400">series of Loebs</a>. These are excellent and have a good index, but aren't yet digitally avaliable or searchable (this will presumably change with the forthcoming <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/loeb/digital.html">Digital Loeb Classical Library</a>). For undergraduates and even scholars hoping to study the fragments, it can be difficult to figure out what may interest them and where to start, but this project aims to remedy this by offering the first freely available and searchable translation, along with tags to aid in exploring them. Finally, there is no repository for bibliography. A great deal of literature about them has appeared in recent years, and they are frequently discussed in the context of other texts. Yet discovering the most recent bibliography about an item can be a very difficult task. This project can help the interested of every level begin to discover the fragments of the Greek comic poets.
	
	<h2>What isn't it?</h2>
	variorum isn't a replacement for Kassel and Austin's <i><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/poetae-comici-graeci-pcg/oclc/18656139">Poetae Comici Graeci</a></i>, the definitive edition of the fragments. The texts given here do not always use the same readings. One will want to consult Kassel-Austin to compare their texts and explore their reasoning behind accepting one reading over another. Readers are also encouraged to compare texts and translations to Storey's Loeb series.
	<h2>The technology</h2>
    	Fragments are encoded in <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</a> and transformed into HTML using XSLT. From there, as much processing as possible is handled on the client side through Javascript; scripting on the server, such as searches on the fragments, uses PHP. Google Fusion Tables and SQL are used to store, select, and insert <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?viz=GVIZ&t=TABLE&q=select+col0%2C+col1%2C+col2%2C+col3+from+1zaUYJa9cPl90Buj5l8QsmJwyEBKRDWJtGuMwrHg&containerId=googft-gviz-canvas">tags</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?viz=GVIZ&t=TABLE&q=select+col0%2C+col2%2C+col1%2C+col3+from+1yoWR-RMIDTDzajMKJrtn_QojabB8927R61fkYpw&containerId=googft-gviz-canvas">bibliography</a>. The merit of this is that it is easily viewable and reusable by others. Performance is worse than simply using a true database on the server, and eventually I may use a database and write a script to mirror them.
